   >REQUIREMENTS
      PHP5.1+
         Because PHP4's extremely stunted OOP layer can't handle the kind
         of stuff Archetype does.

      mod_rewrite
         You must have mod_rewrite to use the provided .htaccess file
         that generally cleans up HTTP interaction with the system.

   >INSTALLATION
      Upload
         Installation is extremely easy.  Make sure your server meets
         the requirements above, then somehow get your copy of Archetype
         on a capable server (requirements) and access
         http://yoursite.com/path/to/install/ with a browser.

         If you see a pretty welcome page, installation successful!  If your
         copy of PHP puffed smoke, something about your server hates the
         software which means your server probably isn't configured well
         or your permissions aren't right.  Archetype should run on any
         working default Apache/PHP5 installation out there.

      Permissions
         Any directory or file that needs to be written to needs to be owned
         by the user running the httpd and both writable and readable by
         that user.  It's suggested you just change the group of the directory
         recursively to whatever Apache is (usually www-data) and permissions
         to 775 so there's no question about Apache writing to the filesystem.

         example:
         chown :www-data ./Archetype/installation -R
         chmod 775 ./Archetype/installation -R

   >TUNING
      mod_rewrite
         Archetype's installation uses mod_rewrite to simplify
         URLs which is both cleaner and more search-engine friendly.
         The .htaccess file is ready to go and in the root
         directory, you'll need mod_rewrite installed and usable.

      magic_quotes
         While Archetype handles magic quotes whether or not you have
         them enabled, it doesn't have to parse through them to fix
         them if you have them disabled.  So if you can, turn off
         magic_quotes_gpc and magic_quotes_runtime in php.ini.
